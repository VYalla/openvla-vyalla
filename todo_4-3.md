# TODO 4-3-25 

- the run inference script was created to run inference on a single image (after downloading the openvla model) 
- make a new repo to put the inference script and run it 
- need to use the libero dataset (it is located at /home/vishal/Documents/openvla_testv1/LIBERO/libero/datasets) 
    - (or find a way to get a sample image to test with  
- use windsurf to run the run_inference script with cmd `python run_inference.py --image_path <path_to_image> --instruction <instruction>`
- afterwards run the libero eval scripts to test performance on dataset 
- next steps => figure out how to intergate the 'framework' paper methods into these models (aka figure out the internal workings)
